# E-COMMERCE LANDING PAGE COPY

## VERSION 1: SIMPLE (Use This First - Google Doc or Notion Page)

**HEADLINE:**
Your Store Has 500 Products. You Post 3 Times a Week.

**SUBHEADLINE:**
Automate Product Content, Customer Service & Email Marketing Using AI
(And Actually Compete with the Big Brands)

---

**THE PROBLEM:**

You started your e-commerce store to sell great products.

Not to spend 25+ hours per week:
- Writing product descriptions
- Creating social media content
- Answering "Where's my order?" messages
- Sending abandoned cart emails
- Managing customer reviews
- Trying to keep up with competitors who post daily

But if you don't do all that? Your competitors win.

And your options all suck:
❌ Do it yourself (no time, inconsistent results)
❌ Hire a VA or marketer ($2,000-4,000/month + training)
❌ Use an agency ($4,000-8,000/month with 2-week turnarounds)
❌ Piecemeal freelancers (expensive, unreliable, hard to manage)

---

**WHAT IF YOU COULD:**

✅ Have every product description optimized for conversions and SEO
✅ Post daily content across all platforms (Instagram, TikTok, Facebook, Pinterest)
✅ Respond to customer inquiries in under 5 minutes, 24/7
✅ Recover 25-30% of abandoned carts automatically
✅ Get 10-20 five-star reviews per month on autopilot
✅ Send personalized email campaigns without thinking about it
✅ Spend 3 hours/month on marketing instead of 25+

All for less than one junior marketer's salary?

**That's what AI automation does for e-commerce.**

---

**HOW IT WORKS:**

**WEEK 1-2: Setup**
We analyze your products, brand voice, and customers. Build AI systems trained specifically on your store.
